rhythmbox-musical-statues
=========================

Trivial Perl script to allow you to participate actively in musical statues/chairs/bumps with your child(ren)

You will need rhythmbox installed of course.

(Linux assumed!)

Usage:
```bash
# start rhythmbox playing a suitable playlist, then...
perl play.pl
```
